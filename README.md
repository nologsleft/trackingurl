# Advanced Browser Fingerprinting & Data Exfiltration Framework

This project is a proof-of-concept browser-based fingerprinting and data collection tool disguised as a Cloudflare "Attention Required" page. It collects a wide range of system, network, and browser metadata from the client, including webcam snapshots, and sends the data to a configured Telegram bot.
